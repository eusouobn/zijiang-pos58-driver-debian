This is a "Fork" of the "zjiang-pos58-driver" (AUR) package maintained by AlexanderS.... https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zijiang-pos58-driver

I just converted the package from AUR to .deb through makedeb-alpha

This is a driver for "Generic" thermal printers... Mine is the "POS-5890Y" model but it probably works with Zijiang ZJ-58, XPrinter XP-58, JZ-80 with cutter, Epson TM-T20 , and may be any other printers understanding ESC/POS commands.

You need to install this driver and then add the printer through the system settings, which will vary according to the graphical interface, but the printer is usually identified as "Unknown (USB)", just select it and then choose the brand "Zijiang" - ZJ-58
